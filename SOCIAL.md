- [ ]  Don't make work socials mandatory

        Social events can be a source of anxiety and should not be a mandatory part of the working experience at your company.

        Some social events may be seen as a tool for being seen and gaining promotions and it's important to ensure your process is fair and balanced and not pivoted upon social performance.

- [ ] Mandatory team days

        Hmm, make these optional too

- [ ]  Don't make work socials mandatory

        Social events can be a source of anxiety and should not be a mandatory part of the working experience at your company.

        Some social events may be seen as a tool for being seen and gaining promotions and it's important to ensure your process is fair and balanced and not pivoted upon social performance.

- [ ] Mandatory team days

        Mandatory team days should come with the same requirements and accomodations normally applied to the neurodivergent person through a normal working day.

        For example if a team day occurs in a different space compared to the office, efforts should be made similar to the office accomomdations, with the need for quiet rooms and to be flexible when supporting sensory needs, a team day can often be very noise and overstimulating, with a huge emphasis on socialising and team acitivties it can be very exhausting, requiring the need for down time, such as several days of having to be alone after the event just to recharge.

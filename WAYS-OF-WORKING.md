# Ways of working

- [ ] Flexi-time

        Define a core set of working hours and give trust to your employees to work their full hours how they choose.

        Consider if core hours need to be specified at all given the type of industry and work the company operate in, if a company is more open with it's working hours and pool of potential employees a wider net of core hours may be of high benefit to the business, having people working cover a general longer working day as a group.

- [ ] In-office flexible arrival times

        To avoid public transport rush hour times, which provide a stressful over stimulating experience to the neurodivergent, they can often be exhausted just from the commute, before the working day has even started.

- [ ] Allow options for remote working

        All meetings should have the option to be remotely dialed in from, even if there is a preference for an in-person meeting, there will always be exceptions to this rule, such as sickness or home responsibilities that are inflexible.

- [ ] Offer hybrid/fully remote options

        Fully remote should be the default preference, with well stated reasons why office working is required on certain days.

        Core hours should be stated trusting the employees to adhere to those but still enable them to have flexible working hours.

        Some neurodivergent people however may be more comfortable working late hours, consideration should be carefully assessed to whether this is viable for your workplace or not, first instinct may be to have this accommodation rejected, even if practical realities make it entire reasonable to support.

        Don't be afraid to suggest compromises and trial periods for different working hours.

- [ ] Provide quiet sensory rooms

        Spaces for no talking, no noises, adequate lighting, away from smells

- [ ] Encourage regular breaks

        keep sacred times scared, i.e. lunch time

        don't encourage brown bag and lunch and learn meetings, schedule them during regular hours (do not infringe on the employees free time) scheduling meetings at such time creates an exclusionary environment

- [ ] Be flexible with a persons working style

        a autistic person may do a single persons work week in a single day, be understanding of this, but the consequence of them continuing to do this day after day for the whole week may result in burnout and time off.

        Encourage a person and reassuring them they've already done enough promotes balance in the work place.

- [ ] Maintaining personal daily structure

        Help them create structure, don't repeatedly challenge a persons structure which can cause stress, such as breaking regular routines.  Do not impose structure upon a person, they must be able to create it themselves and feel in control.

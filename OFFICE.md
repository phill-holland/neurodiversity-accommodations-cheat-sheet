# Setting up your office

Detailed here are features of the modern office which may need to be corrected to provide adequate accommodations, certain environments can be hostile to those with sensory sensitivities.

- [ ] Avoid creating open plan spaces <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-truth-about-open-offices">(The Truth About Open Offices)</a> <a href="https://www.bi.edu/research/business-review/articles/2023/02/open-plan-offices-are-bad-for-business/">(Open Plan Offices Are Bad For Business)</a>        

        Research and evidence suggests that open plan offices are detrimental to productivity to everybody who works in one, regardless of neurotype.

        They are often poorly designed to not take into account traveling sound and other sensory disturbances, such as poor lighting, or smells coming from a kitchen.

        Typically noise travels badly in an open plan office, this is bad for those with sensory disorders relating to noise, which can be draining and make it more difficult to concentrate.

        Autistic people in noisy environments may struggle to identify a single voice, and hear everything all at once, it may give the illusion they cannot hear when in reality they cannot filter out one sound from another.

        Providing enclosed spaces can help, erecting temporary space separators to create micro environments, providing chairs with "wings" that surround your head are also helpful. ("privacy chairs" and "acoustic furniture")

- [ ] Allow noise cancelling headphones

        Noise cancelling headphones are a good coping mechanism for dealing with unwanted and/or disturbing noise, more so when you are physically incapable of filtering out sounds and focussing.

        It's often useful to also establish a convention, for example of somebody is wearing headphones is usually an indication of "do not disturb", if a person struggles to get focussed disturbing them may interrupt their flow and it would be difficult for them to return to such a state.  In such circumstances where they are needed a message can be pinged via Slack or Teams for them to address when they are in an appropriate place to stop.

        it should be noted though that a person should not be made to feel like they have to wear headphones 24/7 in any environment just to cope.

- [ ] Avoid radios and music <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminlaker/2024/08/02/why-your-favorite-music-can-make-or-break-your-workday/">(Why Tou Favourite Music Can Make Or Break Your Workday)</a>

        Having a radio on or music for the whole office to listen to should also be treated as a potential negative sensory issue, if people want to listen to music they should use headphones.

        Whilst it may have a positive effect on some, on others being forced to listen to music not of their choice can be distressing and disturbing, more so if you have sensory issues which make it difficult to easily tune out any kind of background noise.

- [ ] Provide quiet places of retreat (sensory rooms)

        Provide sensory rooms, a place to escape to when needing to retreat from over stimulation.  They should be quiet and away from other disturbances, such as kitchen and restaurant spaces, ideally without internal windows so passers-by won't peer in from curiosity.

        The room should be clearly labelled and placed on office maps if possible, employees should be made aware of the space without having to ask explicitly.

        If possible, a meeting room could be booked out for the whole day and repurposed for this use.

- [ ] Avoid a kitchen in the same space as office working

        Smells and noises (such as those from a coffee machine) can provide unwanted sensory issues to the neurodivergent mindset and prove offense and/or disturbing.

        People also have a tendency to use a kitchen as a ad-hoc meeting room, which can also generate unwanted noise.

        Ideally a kitchen area should not be in the same location as the working space.

        For example, a coffee machine can be loud and be frequently used, this can be extremely disturbing and upsetting to those with a sensitivity towards noise.

- [ ] Avoid Fluorescent and poor incidental lighting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamps_and_health">Flourescent Lamps & Health</a>

        Can they be adjusted?  Bright & poor lighting can also provide a poor sensory experience to everybody not just the neurodiverse, if lighting can be turned off other specific individuals or dimmed in specific areas this can create a more comfortable working area.

        Fluorescent light flicking can create issues such as headaches and eyestrain, particularly with those suffering from light sensitivity, such as those with autism.
        Bright lights can attribute towards sensory overwhelm, resulting in exhausting, meltdowns or burnouts.

        Lighting that reflects poorly off computer screens also contributes towards a bad sensory experience, not just limited to eye strain.

- [ ] Temperature

        Does the office have heating & air condition, can it be adjusted depending on needs?  Again, inability to control temperature may create for a poor sensory experience and result in contributing towards a meltdown.

        An autistic person may have poor thermoception, an inability to realise if they're hot or cold and make suitable adjustments to personal temperature, such as adding or removing clothing layers.

        However, often in a office environment, several people can all have different conflicting comfortable temperatures, often changing the thermostat themselves without regard for others;  sometimes the preference to set the thermostat at a single temperature is acceptable, to prevent arguments - General rule of thumb should be that it's easier to warm up and put on a hoodie or a jumper than it is to cool down. 

- [ ] Sound proofed places to hold calls

        Modern open plan office tend to be very badly designed for noise and other sensory related issues (poor lighting), i.e. everybody can hear everybody else.  For a neurodivergent person it can be difficult to identify one voice from another (all noises tend to be treated equally with no ability to discriminate between sounds or zone out any unwanted noise).

        It's important to support the need for a quiet office by providing specific areas and call booths for an improve office environment.

- [ ] Ensure Smoking areas are not outside windows & ventilation

        Unwanted smoke drifting in from the outside can cause further sensory issues.

        Efforts should be made also to move the smoker areas away from common paths entering and exiting the building, just next to the entrances is a poor choice for smoking area, forcing non-smokers to walk passed poor air-quality on a regular basis.

- [ ] Minimise hot desks, provide dedicated desks where possible
        
        Not knowing whether you have a desk or not when starting on your commute to work can create a lot of anxiety and stress, some of which a neurodiverse person may be unable to handle adequately, this worry may mean they're exhausted before they even start the working day.

        A hot desk environment also encourages people to commute out of normal hours just to reduce the worry of being unable to sit at a desk at all.

        A dedicated desk provides consistency and structure and enables routine that is comforting to people with autism.  It also allows the creation of a safe space and provides a predictable retreat which also be useful for managing anxiety.
        
        Additional factors may also play, autistic people can have strong attention to detail, carefully selecting a desk and all it's attributes is also really important and it may have been chosen very specifically to avoid sensory issues such as noise and poor/reflective lighting. 

- [ ] Relax rules on uniforms/formal office clothing

        Autistic people can struggle with formal clothing due to sensory issues, they may struggle to perform well whilst being unable to stop focussing on uncomfortable clothing, anything from clothing tags, feeling the inner seams of clothes, unable to cope with the material an item is made from can all contribute to a poor experience.  
        
        They can often spend months if not years looking for the exact type of clothing that doesn't provide any sensory issues at all!

# Setting up your office

Detailed here are features of the modern office which may need to be correct to provide adequate accommodations

- [ ] Open plan

    Research and evidence suggests that open plan offices are determental to productivity to everybody who works in one, regardless of neurotype.

    They are often poorly designed to take into account travelling sound and over disturbances, often with poor lighting.

- [ ] Travelling noise

    Can you hear everything everybody else is doing on the office space?  This is bad for those with sensory disorders relating to noise, which can be draining and make it more difficult to concentrate.

    Autistic people in noisy environments may struggle to identify a single voice, and hear everything all at once, it may give the illusion they cannot hear when in reality they cannot filter out one sound from another.

- [ ] Quiet places of retreat

        Provide sensory rooms, a place to escape to when needing to retreat from over stimulation.

        If possible, a meeting room could be booked out for the whole expressly for this purpose.

- [ ] Kitchen in same place as office

        Smells and noises (such as those from a coffee machine) can provide unwanted sensory issues to the neurodivergent mindset and prove offense and/or disturbing.

        People also have a tendancy to use a kitchen as a ad-hoc meeting room, which can also generate unwanted noise.

        Ideally a kitchen area should not be in the same location as the working space.

- [ ] Flourestent/poor lighting

        Can they be adjusted?  Bright & poor lighting can also provide a poor sensory experience to the neurotypical mindset, if lighting can be turned off individual or dimmed in specific areas this can create a more comfortable working area.

        Bright lights can attribute towards sensory overwhelm, resulting in exhausting, meltdowns or burnouts.

- [ ] Temperature

        Does the office have heating & air condition, can it be adjusted depending on needs?  Again, inability to control temperature may create for a poor sensory experience and result in contributing towards a meltdown.

        However, often in a office environment, several people can all have different confortable temperatures, often changing the thermostate themselves without regard for others;  sometimes the preference to set the thermostat at a single temperature is acceptable, to prevent arguments.

        General rule of thumb should be that it's easier to warm up and put on a hoodie or a jumper than it is to cool down. 

- [ ] Sound proofed places to hold calls

        Modern open plan office tend to be very badly designed for noise and other sensory related issues (poor lighting), i.e. everybody can hear everybody else.  For a neurodivergent person it can be difficult to identify one voice from another (all noises tend to be treated equally with no ability to discriminate between sounds or zone out any unwanted noise).

        It's important to support the need for a quiet office by providing specific areas and call booths for an improve office environment.

- [ ] Smokers are not outside open windows

        Unwanted smoke drifting in from the outside can cause further sensory issues.

        Efforts should be made also to move the smoker areas away from common paths entering and exiting the building, just next to the entrances is a poor choice for smoking area, forcing non-smokers to walk passed poor air-quailty on a regular basis.

- [ ] No hot desking

        Can have a seat adjusted to your needs, can provide a safe space and a nest, removing uncertainity & anxeity of getting a desk when arriving at the office, whilst many neurotypical people may adapt better to working from a different desk, or even being OK if there is no specific desk to work at a neurodivergent person may struggle with the change and inconsistency, not knowingly having a desk to arrive at can be a source of extreme stress during the commute into work.

        Additional factors may also play, xarefully selecting a desk and all it's attributes is also really important and it may have been choosen very specifically to avoid sensory issues such as noise and poor/reflective lighting.

# Promotions Processes

Typical promotion processes may be hugely bais against neurodivergent employees.  placing themselves under scrunity and feedback from others can be stress inducing more than the typical person.

A typical promotions process may be entirely hostile to the neurodivergent person.

A neurodivergent person has a lot of other things to contend with and often have to work and fight harder than most people just to do typically normal things than others perform without stress.

Often a promotions process may require a feedback process, seeking input from others in the workplace, a neurodivergent person may already be higher critical of themselves with personal high standards, and with disproportionate low self-worth and self-opinon, having to integrate constructive critcism from others when already to tough personal standards, if not well can be an experiement most neurodivergent people with avoid at all costs.

It's also important to note with a feedback culture that most people need training to offer good constructed criticism, that isn't subjective and is more objective.

Criticism without the option for the receipient to reject or argue against has no value, and suggest a in-balance of power within the work place.

A promotions process may also include a formal presentation, which also may not be appealing to the strengths of the nueropdivgent, often feeling it should be obvious that if management are doing their jobs successfully they should already know why the individual should deserve a promotion.

There is often a lot of unconcious bias against a person who expresses themselves differently and communications different from everybody else;  if you perhaps don't match the typical model of a more senior person in the organisation even if you are capable of the job you can be discriminated against.

You may also be excluded from a promotions process if you avoid after-work social events and not being visible seen and engaging in discussions with other senior team members, those who may be responsible for approving promotions.

As a employer, attempts should be made to encouarge and identify those who deserve promotions, often they may be unaware of the promotions process if one exists, or general incapable of understanding the implied social rules and rituals one must perform in order to get recognised for their work contributes, even if their work speaks for itself.

A neurodivergent person may be extremely hard on themselves about whether they deserve a promotion, even if that doesn't match with their performance, after a life time of having to adapt to those who've treated them as if they're a little bit odd or different and therefore inferior often they'll need extra encouragement.

Often autistic neurodivergent people, if they make it into employment at all, are often under hired, or comparitively behind in their career compared to their peers due to poor understanding of the needs of the neurodivergent; often the only reason they are behind is how other people pecieve them and their behaviour rather than directly related to their skillset and capabilities.

They may have reputations they've carried with them about being blunt or inappropriate and therefore a poor choice of representation in front of a client, despite proving the contary of building strong relationships with people;  often neurodivergent have had to learn compensation strategies for dealing with people and are better communicatoes than others around them perceive, often reading a room and characters much better than their counterparts, making better judgements.

job interviewers


job descriptions

include salary, be concise

specific the skilsl required concisely, do not confuse with "nice to have skills", which aren't specific enough
to make a solid choice

be detailed, do not elude to culture, be honest!! (even if you think it's bad, most likely this will help a person make a more informed decision, some people will be up-for-the-honesty)

if you offer hybrid working, be specific about amount of days in the office.  do not be vague, i.e. 2 to 3 days, which is it 2 or 3 days? will the person get into trouble for attend 2 days a week?  what are expectations in reality?

reasonable accomdations

allow options to attend remotely, give freedom for them to turn off camera if they require it

allow options for the interviewee to request breaks if required (suggest breaks are avaible at the beginning of the meeting)

provide a list of questions you'll be asking before hand (allows time to prepare beforehand, allows somebody autistic to plan answers carefully and not be shocked by the unexpected) -- this does not mean a natural conversation cannot occur

be patient if the person asks for clarification of your questions, consider if you have communicated what you wanted to know from them successful (see communication.md)


if interviews have to happen in-person, ensure room is;

quiet

lights are adjustable

frequent breaks still required (somebody is allowed to go off a find a quiet room for a bit)

ensure people have fluids and drinks available to them from the start, water/drinks

interviews with (technical) tests;


tests are a source of anixety, consider how a person may communication;  talking about yourself and previous work roles is mentally intensive to the ND person, it's harder work than the average person, with the additional load asking them to context switch into a technical mindset during an already stressful situtation is very difficult, they will likely fail at this task, even if they are capable IRL of doing such things are pair programming, or mentoring, or explaining code to others (in wich they'd usually have time to themsleves to understand the code)

don't assume everybody works and thinks in the same way, leave room for differences in thinking and comunication;  you may have a specific answer in mind, but might view a vastly different approach to problem solving as a negative, don't enforce the same mthodology you have upon a person to solve a problem.

think about if the test is strictly nessercary;  can this information be gauged from other swources? (i.e. github, open source)  A test might not bne required if a person shows clear evidence of a long successful career in the industry, more show if they're demonstrated adaptability.

can the test be performed outside of hte interview, in the interviewees own time?

interview tests are entirely afritically situtations, often with poorly designed tests that only test to see if a person is any good at intgerviews, rather than performing well in a working environment

often tests are desigend to show superiourity opf tghe interviewer, with brain twisters, or puzzles rather than realistic examples from the real world.  It is difficult to design a test well.


number of interviews;

reduce number of intgerviews a person may go through to the absolute minimum

length of interviews;

an hour, but must not exceed two hours, with options for frequent breaks (if A person does not suggest this, it's recommended you suggest this to the interviewee regardless, they may be too scared to suggest anything)

Any questions at the end;

give the interviewee viable and concrete ways of asking questsions after the interview has ended

responses

promptly give a rejection/acceptance message within a few weeks. ND people tend to be driven by anxiety and the unknown, mitigate this by being efficient and prompt if possible.




negoiation

be honest, and offer a fair salary to the person you're interviewing, the interviewee will want you to be truthful

# Interviews

State statistics here. why is a job interview more difficult for the ND person?


- [ ] Ensure all attendees to job interviews have a copy of the questions that will be asked before hand

        Job interviews tend to be artificial scenarios , and often the only thing a job interview does is test to see if a person is good at job interviews, and not if they'll be suited towards the job role, neurodiverse people tend to be terrible at job interviews due to this artificial construct.

        having questions published before hand allows people time to formulate appropriate answers, often a source of anxiety for the ND person during a job interview is the unknown, publishing and giving as much details as possible about the recruitment process helps mitigate this.

        
- [ ] Ensure any interview tests are conducted offline

        ND people often put in a large amount of effort to effectively communicate with others, often meeting the other parties more than half way and over-compensate, it can be difficult during a job interview process to then context switch between "speaking mode" to "thinking mode" where they may have to demonstrate a technical skill in real-time, it's important to reduce this context switching to the minimum during a job interview.

        Again, job interview tests are often artificially created and have no bearing on real-world workflow and tasks that they'll be given.

- [ ] Consider if testing is required

        Seek alternative methods of proving ability, beyond the need for a test.  - maybe they have a github showing their work publish elsewhere?

        A test is often created artificially and does not server the purpose to see how well a person may perform in a work environment, ensure you are not testing to see if a person is good at job interviews, and not good at performing the job role.

        A test can be time consuming, and if a person already has a long career history in the industry and interviewing for a senior, it's far to assume they are already capable of what you require of them, that cannot be found out without a general chat or consultation with the persons references.

        Often a test needs to be well designed, and most of the time it becomes more about the current employees of a company designing puzzles to show superiority 
        over the employee rather than testing their ability.

- [ ] Allow for remote interview options


    if interviews have to happen in-person, ensure room is;

    - [ ] quiet

    - [ ] away from kitchens, noise and smells

    - [ ] lights are adjustable/dimmable

    - [ ] frequent breaks still required (somebody is allowed to go off a find a quiet room for a bit)

    - [ ] ensure people have fluids and drinks available to them from the start, water/drinks

    - [ ] Allow for camera to be turned off

    - [ ] Don't insist on a handshake


- [ ] Give time for processing questions

        Offer clarification of questions, don't be upset if somebody asks for clarifications


- [ ] Ensure the interviewee has adequate amounts of breaks during the interview

        Reenforce that they can ask for breaks themselves any time they want, even if they do not ask, suggests breaks yourself.


# In-person interviews

Ideally, interviews should be conducted remotely, if conducting in-person;

- [ ] Don't insist on a handshake when meeting and saying goodbye

        Old school interviewers would see this as a test of a person, how hard can they handshake, how welcoming is there handshake, this is an old out dated standard,  unwanted Physical contact can often be distressing to a person and serves no useful purpose.

- [ ] Quiet room away from distractions

        More modern offices can have glass walls, move the candidate chair with it's back facing the glass wall to avoid distractions. 

        Ideally the room should be aware from distraction smells, such as kitchens and restaurants.

- [ ] Be aware of meeting room lighting conditions

        Offer to dim lights, or turn off to the candidate

- [ ] Offer a drink and refreshments

- [ ] Offer regular breaks

        point out quiet zones of the office for the interviewee to retreat 

- [ ] Provide detailed maps and directions to the office and interview location

        Be as specific as possible, if theres a reception area be clear of this

# Recruiters

- [ ] Don't hide details in the job advert

        Such as salary, company you'll be working for.  No salary published is a red flag.  Often ND people will be under hired if they're in work at all, and will be taken advantage of, due to the predilection towards honest during a salary negotiation.

- [ ] Ensure job description is specific

        Often job descriptions are generic and all sound the same, which can you offer differently to other companies?

- [ ] Be comfortable with text communication

        Don't immediately insist on a phone call after making initial contact with the potential interviewee, consider different communication preference methods, be more amenable to the person

- [ ] gives details to accommodations for remote working for disabilities, publish clearly and publicly

        If you're advertising for hybrid or office work, ensure those with disabilities will not be put off because accommodations have not been publish and reasonable adjustments.  **right-to-work

- [ ] Don't expect an immediate response

        Don't discount a persons employability by the speed at which they respond to you, be patient, don't push with artificial deadlines.

        Often those whom are autistic are part at a disadvantage, needing extra time to decide if they want the job or not, and whether to apply or not.  Crafting the perfect response can be difficult and it takes time. 

- [ ] be aware of communication preferences and differences

        Some people don't like phone calls immediately after reaching out for a job application, most job application systems provide initial chat messaging before moving onto to a verbal stage.

- [ ] Make application process as simple as possible

        A majority of application websites have their own web forms for filling in sections of experience details, often forcing an applicant to repeat the process (some offer AI CV interpreters to help, but these rarely ever work 100% effectively)

        Forcing needless repetitive work is likely to put off applications, when they've spent a lot of time formatting a well detailed CV.

- [ ] Avoid generic questions such as "why do you want to work for X company?"

        Often people on the spectrum are extremely honest and won't know how to answer this question, questions like this may serve no useful function and often just an open invitation to lie to all applicants regardless of neurotypes.

# Advertisements

- [ ] Have you published you ND working accommodations and policy onto your website?

        Publish what neurodiverse accommodations you are willing to make publicly, don't make people ask for them, if you have a ND policy, make it public, link it on your website  - do not make people click a checkbox, describe and prove you have already thought about the process and what support you as a company have in place for a ND employee.

- [ ] Details of the interview process are published

        Including number of interview stages, and details of what happens at each stage, including length of each meeting stage.  Do not put excessive time demands on the person being interviewed.

- [ ] "desireable traits"

        Often a job advertisement has desirable traits, either these are part of the job, or they are not, this is variable in-concise list subject to the whim of the hiring party, such a list makes it more difficult to understand the rules of hiring.

        Consider reducing this to a single list of essential traits, make a firm decision about what you do and don't want in an employee.

- [ ] Be concise in job description

        An autistic individual will find it difficult to read in-between the lines and will avoid applying for a job if the details are not concise and if they do not match well with their skill-sets, when in reality a job may be flexible with the advertised skill-set.  
        
        Generic job descriptions could likely put off highly qualified individuals.

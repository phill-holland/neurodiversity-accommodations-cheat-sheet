// *****


Often during communication there is a lot of implied context, sub-text and references that are left unspoken between participants with an assumption that both sides understand that implied meaning - but this isn't always the case, even between neurotypicals as well as the neurodivergent.

A person may be confident that are an effective communicator, perhaps because they are warm and friendly and talkative but under scrunity they may actually exchange very little useful information.  

Just because the two parties in a conversation made each other feel good does not mean they have effectively communicated what they needed to say.  Just because the outcome of a conversation was positive too, when perhaps one person asks another person to do a task and they complete it successfully, still does not validate the effectiveness of the communication.

Context and meaning isn't always communicated during a single conversation, but often references many other previous conversations, often people develop their own ways of using the English language, referencing past shared events with single words and sound that mean very little to the casual external observer.   

These references and context don't just occur between two people in isloation, but can happen on a larger scale within society as a whole, and those references may never be spoken or shared amongst people formally, society has an abundance of unspoken rules that neurotypicallys follow naturally.

In generalised society hidden meaning and context can be easier for a neurotypical person to pick up on, context can be gauged subconciously from other social cues that the neurodivergent person may not be able to read, this may include body language and facial expressions and reading how other people are reacting to the words being spoken.


Communication differences and misunderstandings are usually placed at the fault of the neurodivergent person in the conversation when something is miscommunicated, but often the fault is rarely ever due to a single person, often the average person communicates intent and meaning and needs in a un-concise and indirect way.

Take this example;

```
"What do you think of my new dress?"
```

This is a loaded question, it is a trap, the person asking the question is most likely not seeking an honest answer, they are fishing for a compliment, even if it's the most ugly dress in the world you lose the game if you say this out loud.  The literal meaning of the words spoken do not communicate this need for positive validation.  It is also an open ended question, lacking specifics, what specifically are you asking about the dress, do I like the colour and pattern?, the choice of fabric?, the way it is cut? 

The person asking the question has communicated badly about what they actually need from the other person.

Take this example, where a manager is talking to a member of their team;

```
"Can you finished that off by tomorrow afternoon?"
```





"the bark is worse than their bite"







More frequently too, people may use 


neurotypically minds tend to pick up on those hidden meanings without having to be told directly, it comes naturally whilst the neurodivegent mind struggles because t




"darmok and jalad at tangara"


that built context may be shared amongst a large population of people that come naturally to the neurotypical


even though people may use English as a primary language and the words sound English

establishing preferences and respecting them

Tasks need to be communicated concisely
●Communication preferences may not be verbal - ESTABLISH COMMS PREFERENCES, WRITTEN/VERBAL - other?? interpretive dance?
●Extra time may be needed to process information
●Having the camera on and making eye contact may be uncomfortable
●Try to avoid interruption people in mid-sentence


Be patient, some people take longer to form sentences than others

# Interviews

// ***********



job interviewers


job descriptions

include salary, be concise

specific the skilsl required concisely, do not confuse with "nice to have skills", which aren't specific enough
to make a solid choice

be detailed, do not elude to culture, be honest!! (even if you think it's bad, most likely this will help a person make a more informed decision, some people will be up-for-the-honesty)

if you offer hybrid working, be specific about amount of days in the office.  do not be vague, i.e. 2 to 3 days, which is it 2 or 3 days? will the person get into trouble for attend 2 days a week?  what are expectations in reality?

reasonable accomdations

allow options to attend remotely, give freedom for them to turn off camera if they require it

allow options for the interviewee to request breaks if required (suggest breaks are avaible at the beginning of the meeting)

provide a list of questions you'll be asking before hand (allows time to prepare beforehand, allows somebody autistic to plan answers carefully and not be shocked by the unexpected) -- this does not mean a natural conversation cannot occur

be patient if the person asks for clarification of your questions, consider if you have communicated what you wanted to know from them successful (see communication.md)


if interviews have to happen in-person, ensure room is;

quiet

lights are adjustable

frequent breaks still required (somebody is allowed to go off a find a quiet room for a bit)

ensure people have fluids and drinks available to them from the start, water/drinks

interviews with (technical) tests;


tests are a source of anixety, consider how a person may communication;  talking about yourself and previous work roles is mentally intensive to the ND person, it's harder work than the average person, with the additional load asking them to context switch into a technical mindset during an already stressful situtation is very difficult, they will likely fail at this task, even if they are capable IRL of doing such things are pair programming, or mentoring, or explaining code to others (in wich they'd usually have time to themsleves to understand the code)

don't assume everybody works and thinks in the same way, leave room for differences in thinking and comunication;  you may have a specific answer in mind, but might view a vastly different approach to problem solving as a negative, don't enforce the same mthodology you have upon a person to solve a problem.

think about if the test is strictly nessercary;  can this information be gauged from other swources? (i.e. github, open source)  A test might not bne required if a person shows clear evidence of a long successful career in the industry, more show if they're demonstrated adaptability.

can the test be performed outside of hte interview, in the interviewees own time?

interview tests are entirely afritically situtations, often with poorly designed tests that only test to see if a person is any good at intgerviews, rather than performing well in a working environment

often tests are desigend to show superiourity opf tghe interviewer, with brain twisters, or puzzles rather than realistic examples from the real world.  It is difficult to design a test well.


number of interviews;

reduce number of intgerviews a person may go through to the absolute minimum

length of interviews;

an hour, but must not exceed two hours, with options for frequent breaks (if A person does not suggest this, it's recommended you suggest this to the interviewee regardless, they may be too scared to suggest anything)

Any questions at the end;

give the interviewee viable and concrete ways of asking questsions after the interview has ended

responses

promptly give a rejection/acceptance message within a few weeks. ND people tend to be driven by anxiety and the unknown, mitigate this by being efficient and prompt if possible.




negoiation

be honest, and offer a fair salary to the person you're interviewing, the interviewee will want you to be truthful





# Meetings

// **********************

culture in office

meetings have to have a point?

communicated successful the agenda?

- purpose of meeting

- outcome of meeting

This gives people time to prepare, and also provides enough detail forf them to decide if theyh should attend or not



enabling freedom not to attend if they feel they will not contribute anything useless, or learn anything useful

record meetings for later

meetings should have options to be attended remotely, and not mandatory in-person


remote attendees should have the option to have the camera off (it doesn't mean they're not listening or paying attention)



# Office

// *****************


office environment survey/checklist

open plan - link to supporting documents about
how open plan reduces productivity

separate kitchen - for smells

temperature controled

is the lighting natural, too bright, fluorescent

quiet spaces to retreat from noises

accessibility

office space acccesibility with wheelchair access (both 
in an emergency situtation, where elevators would be unsafe to use)

// no
check for wireless signals, that may interfer with
colleqare implants



temperate

light

smells

noises

MUSIC RADIOS

REASONABLE ACCOMDDATIONS

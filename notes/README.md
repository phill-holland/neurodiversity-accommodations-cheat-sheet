# Neurodiversity Accomodations Checklist/Scoring

## Who am I?

I am a late diagnosis autistic indivdual working in the technology industry as a software engineer.

I am not a trained medical professional, nor am I a formally trained expert on neurodiversity, this list is created from personal lived experiences and personal research into the subject of neurodiversity, and more explictly autism.


## Why create this? 

State low autistic employment rates

## Who is this for?

// ***
ADHD Autism, employees and employers

I found there wasn't a detailed playbook for what and how to ask for neurodiversity related accomodations of things to ask for and to adjust to, finding a starting point can be daunting without a deep understanding of your condition and how it relates to you personally.

After gaining a diagnosis, it can feel like a door has open suddenly flunge wide upon into an endless pool of light, you know you need help, but as an adult not many resources exists post diagnosis to aid and guide you into effect decision making to support your own interests.

You don't know what to ask for, and often those you need to ask are equally uneducated on the subject and can provide little assistant for accomdations, they'll look towards you for guidance.  

If you are well prepared, with good resources behind you that explains adequdately reasonably accomdations there is no reason why your requests should be rejected.  However the keyword here is "reasonable" and highly subjective to interpretation

You can be overwhelemd with a set of conflicting feelings and thoughts about whether you should ask for accomdations, whether you are "autistic" or broken enough to deserve those accomdations.  Guilt can cloud personal judgement about what accomdations to ask for, for people who may not be used to asking for any help whatsoever with a lifetime of perpetual people pleasing and pushing yourself and needs to one side in an effort to hide your struggles and fit in with other people.

you can be lost in a world 

Whilst I only havea singular perspective of a lived (and personal) autistic experience I'm hoping this list is also applicable to those with ADHD, or at least can be easily adapted to suit your more personal needs.

This is a general outline and guideline, and by no-means a complete and concise playbook on the subject, but it is a start from a subject that is lacking information on the subject of 

other neurodiversity conditions. 

## Asking for accomodations..

..can be a daunting experience, more so for the newly diagnose who may be struggling with concepts of self advocating and self acceptance, it is difficult to gauge and judge what exactly you need when you may have also had years of denial and gasliting to contend with and un-pick.

Finding that confidence to self advocate for accommodations can be met with brain fog and confusion, it requires self acceptence and needing a safe space to re-test your own boundaries and capabilities, whilst avoiding burnout and meltdowns.

Information, research and knowledge here are of paramount importance, enabling you to confidently ask for adjustments, and be ready with suggestions for how accomodations might work and how they might be successfully implmentation to the benefit of yourself and your employer, if you're well looked after, you are more productive, this value needs to be emphasised to your employer.

It's important to keep reminding yourself as an employee that you are not asking for special treatment, or exceptional

## Risks

Ssking for accomodations can single you out amongst other employees if not sensitively handled by management,

# purpose of this repo


This is designed for those in the work place wishing to educate themselves more on adjustments in the work place for the neurodiverse indivdual, or give ideas directly for the neurodiverse individual for ideas of what adjustments to ask for.

some of the suggestions here may be deemed <b>"unreasonable adjustments"</b> which I should probably talk more about somewhere, which is often a subjective view point, often met with push-back; we should not confuse reasonable adjustments with things that are easy to do, and we should not confuse the denial of reasonable adjustments beacuse a) everybody else is doing ok, b) it goes against traditional working praticsed and behaviours, just because something has always been done that way does not mean it should contiune to work in that way.

Neurodiversity is an important emerging topic in the last few years, with developments made in ADHD and Autism diagnosises, frequency of diagnosis is increasing dramatically as more and more is understood about these conditions.

However a lot more educational work about correcting some of the misunderstandings of Autism/ADHD/ND needs to be done amongst the general populus, stereotypically representations of autistic indivduals within the media world has been damaging, such as rain man, and sheldon cooper in the big bang theory; of a incredibly smart but unempathic and emotionally numb male persona that likes trains.

/* top wank here needs rewriting to be less sloppy */

Autism expands beyond these stereotypes and has been damaging to those outside of them, such females and members of the BAME community, often being missed by formally diagnositic processes because they don't adhere to this commonly advertised trope.

Autism in many different countries aroudn the world is considered a disability, in  this context it can be viewed as a disablity by environmental circumstances, autisim is a difference in the way a person think and how their brain is wired, this causes conflict and distress when navigating a world built for a neurotypical mindset.

In a world which struggles to acknowledge and accomodate such differences, a person can suffer burnout and meltdowns due to several different factors that they may or may not be personal aware of just by performing their daily routine, they may struggle with noisy environments, or bright lights, unwanted smells, disruptions to routine and lack of structure.

There is also a substantial toll imposed upon an autistic indivdual who is unable to behave and act like a neurotpyical indivdual, causing them to mask and act like every other person just to avoid deregation and bullying, or to avoid being persistently the blame for repeated poor communications issues.

The world in it's current form is not a very inclusion place and this needs to change, with enough individual voices shouting in unison the world can begin to slowly change foer the better, with understanding and inclusion playing a key role.

Making the world a more neurodiverse inclusive place makes it a world better for everybody.

There is a low number (30% or lower) of Autistic people in employment when there needn't be, struggling to successfully pass through a typical interview process, and survive, with adjustments and awareness to the ismple changes a work environment can make, we make the world more inclusion for the autistic community.

<b>The aim is not to give the average autistic person an advantage over everybody else, but to level the playing field so that they are on equal footing and given the chance to succeed.

Life is hard on the spectrum, you're dealing an internal struggle 24/7 with your brain and thought processes, with an overwhelming volume of information coming at you all of the time, you can be exhausted even before the day starts.
</b>

We must all help to build a world that identifies everybodies unqiue strengths and appeals to them, and not build a world that focusses on individuals weaknesses and views them through a magnifying glass.

Creating a "test-your-metal" world and mentality where everbody is pushed & stressed to their limits to demonstrate that they're capable of fitting in the world is something we need to discourge.

Somebodies value should be be judged by how well they can deal with being pushed to their limits and our acceptences of another persons should not be limited to how useful we think they are to society and ourselves.

It is recommended that accommidations should be granted to everybody, just just the neurodiverse employees.

In this document we cover adjusatments in the following AREAS;

- office environment

    How to survey an office for potential sensory issues, with recommended simple fixes and warnings of potential cost implications

- meetings

    A detailed instructions for how to schedule meetings sensibly and reasonably

- communications

    Communication issues are rarely the fault of a single individual, but the fault of every party involved in the conversation, we should not assign blame to any person when it fails, but collectively work harder to improve communication difficults and reach a middle ground.

- job interviews 

- ways of working

    Suggestions of accomidations and adjustments for the ND indivdual, that might go down like a tonne of bricks

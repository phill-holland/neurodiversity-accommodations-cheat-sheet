    Explanation of some of the language used in this document

## Who am I?

I am a late diagnosised autistic indivdual working in the technology industry as a software engineer.

I am not a trained medical professional, nor am I a formally trained expert on neurodiversity, this list is created from personal lived experiences and personal research into the subject of neurodiversity, and more explictly autism.

## Why create this? 

Autistic and neudodiverse indivduals are typically commonly not in employment, despite a willingness to work and having a good skillset to offer, the workplace can be designed from a neurotpyical perspective which may be hostile towards an autistic individual.

There is a widespread lack of understanding of what an autistic individual may need to help them thrive within the work place, and also a general misunderstanding of neurodiverse conditions such as autistic and ADHD.

They are disabled by environment, rather than by any other factor, autism is a condition rather than a disorder, in the same way a person in a wheelchair may need a ramp instead of stairs to be self sufficient, somebody with autism also needs accommodations within the environment in order to function fully within society.

## Who is this for?

This is general guide for both employee and employer, but more specifically the language is crafted to appeal to the employee, this is for people on both side of the fence, seeking a starting point for guidance on what accommodations can be asked for reasonable with a brief explaination of why and the consquences should an accommodation not be provided.

I have written this mainly from the perspective of an autistic individual, but hoping that a lot of the accodations and tips here can be adapted to others who also identify as neurodiverse, such as those with ADHD.

I found there wasn't a detailed playbook for what and how to ask for neurodiversity related accommodations of specificy changes to ask for and to adjust to, finding a starting point can be daunting without a deep understanding of your condition and how it relates to you personally.

After gaining a diagnosis, it can feel like a door has open suddenly flunge wide upon into an endless pool of light, you know you need help, but as an adult not many resources exists post diagnosis to aid and guide you into effective decision making to support your own interests, accommodations aren't that easy to personally define and even that confidence in self that you truly need and deserve them.

You don't know what to ask for, and often those you need to ask are equally uneducated on the subject and can provide little assistant for accommodations ideas unless they've had previous experience before, they'll look towards you for guidance.  

You can be overwhelemd with a set of conflicting feelings and thoughts about whether you should ask for accomdations, whether you are "autistic" or broken enough to deserve those accomdations.  Guilt can cloud personal judgement about what accomdations to ask for, for people who may not be used to asking for any help whatsoever with a lifetime of perpetual people pleasing and pushing yourself and needs to one side in an effort to hide your struggles and fit in with other people.

If you are well prepared, with good resources behind you that explains adequdately reasonably accomdations there is no reason why your requests should be rejected.  However it important to note that "reasonable" is highly subjective to interpretation, it's important during your requests to reduce the subjective interpretation and explaining succiently why you need the accommodations, leaving little room for

## Asking for accommodations..

..can be a daunting experience, more so for the newly diagnose who may be struggling with concepts of self advocating and self acceptance, it is difficult to gauge and judge what exactly you need when you may have also had years of denial and gasliting to contend with and un-pick.

Finding that confidence to self advocate for accommodations can be met with brain fog and confusion, it requires self acceptence and needing a safe space to re-test your own boundaries and capabilities, whilst avoiding burnout and meltdowns.

Information, research and knowledge here are of paramount importance, enabling you to confidently ask for adjustments, and be ready with suggestions for how accommodations might work and how they might be successfully implmentation to the benefit of yourself and your employer, if you're well looked after, you are more productive, this value needs to be emphasised to your employer.

It's important to keep reminding yourself as an employee that you are not asking for special treatment, you are asking for the playing field to be level, for equality. 

When asking for accommodations you're asking for the same opportunities as other employees and for the barriers to be removed to being able to spend time in the office without it being hostile to your sensory needs, being able to engage in a promotions process where the quaility of your work counts for more than than your ability to socialise outside of work, and being able to reach the end of the day and not be physically and mentally exhausted to engage in personal hobbies and interests.

It's likely if you're an late diagnosised autistic adult in employment, that you've already experienced exclusion behaviours in the workplace, you may be under hired and feel exploited because you are unable to "play to game" that others perform so instinctly, if you're employment at all.  

accommodations are often needed to open the door of opporutnity that have otherwise been unavailable to you, depsite having all the relevent skillset and experiences you still feel have passed you over.

## Risks

Asking for accommodations can single you out amongst other employees if not sensitively handled by management, again, an emphasis must be placed on ensuring accommodations aren't seen as expectional treatment for individuals by other employees.

There will be accommodations only relevent to the specific neurodivergent person, but more often than not it should be considered if an granted accomodation might not be suited to being offered to all the employees within a work place, if accommodations are seen as a mostly positive change within the workforce, that may results in improved employee performance, why not extend them to others?

It is important your employee fully understands what it means to be neurodiverse and live life as an autistic individual, they may adhere to stereotypical versions of people with autism and ADHD, such as Rainman, Sheldon Cooper and Bart Simpson, this may result in employers being less sympathetic towards individual who do not present appearences adhering to these sterotypes, i.e. they may not take you seriously if you do not look "autistic enough" to them.

it's important you have some understanding of how your employer will react to your disclosure at being autistic, you should edcuate yourself upon the legal rights you have to ask for accommodations in your country, but you should take adequate steps to protect yourself and know what to do next if your accommodations are rejected, or agreed to but not enforced or supported by your employer.

Your employers behaviour may not be fully in-line with the law of your country,  you should be aware if you do raise accommodation requests of any change in behaviour towards you that may not be positive.

You may be in the position where you also have to be the one educating them on the subject of neurodiversity.

Autism and neurodiversity understanding varies dramatically from country-to-country, it's important you use your bests judgement related to your country and work place to protect yourself and your interests in the best way possible.

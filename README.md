RATE EACH SUGGESTION BY HOW LIKELY IT IS TO BE ACCEPTED IN THE WORK PLACE

SUGGSET CHEAP WAYS TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES

This is designed for those in the work place wishing to educate themselves more on adjustments in the work place for the neurodiverse indivdual, or give ideas directly for the neurodiverse individual for ideas of what adjustments to ask for.

some of the suggestions here may be deemed <b>"unreasonable adjustments"</b> which I should probably talk more about somewhere, which is often a subjective view point, often met with push-back; we should not confuse reasonable adjustments with things that are easy to do, and we should not confuse the denial of reasonable adjustments beacuse a) everybody else is doing ok, b) it goes against traditional working praticsed and behaviours, just because something has always been done that way does not mean it should contiune to work in that way.

Neurodiversity is an important emerging topic in the last few years, with developments made in ADHD and Autism diagnosises, frequency of diagnosis is increasing dramatically as more and more is understood about these conditions.

However a lot more educational work about correcting some of the misunderstandings of Autism/ADHD/ND needs to be done amongst the general populus, stereotypically representations of autistic indivduals within the media world has been damaging, such as rain man, and sheldon cooper in the big bang theory; of a incredibly smart but unempathic and emotionally numb male persona that likes trains.

/* top wank here needs rewriting to be less sloppy */

Autism expands beyond these stereotypes and has been damaging to those outside of them, such females and members of the BAME community, often being missed by formally diagnositic processes because they don't adhere to this commonly advertised trope.

Autism in many different countries aroudn the world is considered a disability, in  this context it can be viewed as a disablity by environmental circumstances, autisim is a difference in the way a person think and how their brain is wired, this causes conflict and distress when navigating a world built for a neurotypical mindset.

In a world which struggles to acknowledge and accomodate such differences, a person can suffer burnout and meltdowns due to several different factors that they may or may not be personal aware of just by performing their daily routine, they may struggle with noisy environments, or bright lights, unwanted smells, disruptions to routine and lack of structure.

There is also a substantial toll imposed upon an autistic indivdual who is unable to behave and act like a neurotpyical indivdual, causing them to mask and act like every other person just to avoid deregation and bullying, or to avoid being persistently the blame for repeated poor communications issues.

The world in it's current form is not a very inclusion place and this needs to change, with enough individual voices shouting in unison the world can begin to slowly change foer the better, with understanding and inclusion playing a key role.

Making the world a more neurodiverse inclusive place makes it a world better for everybody.

There is a low number (30% or lower) of Autistic people in employment when there needn't be, struggling to successfully pass through a typical interview process, and survive, with adjustments and awareness to the ismple changes a work environment can make, we make the world more inclusion for the autistic community.

<b>The aim is not to give the average autistic person an advantage over everybody else, but to level the playing field so that they are on equal footing and given the chance to succeed.

Life is hard on the spectrum, you're dealing an internal struggle 24/7 with your brain and thought processes, with an overwhelming volume of information coming at you all of the time, you can be exhausted even before the day starts.
</b>

We must all help to build a world that identifies everybodies unqiue strengths and appeals to them, and not build a world that focusses on individuals weaknesses and views them through a magnifying glass.

Creating a "test-your-metal" world and mentality where everbody is pushed & stressed to their limits to demonstrate that they're capable of fitting in the world is something we need to discourge.

Somebodies value should be be judged by how well they can deal with being pushed to their limits and our acceptences of another persons should not be limited to how useful we think they are to society and ourselves.

It is recommended that accommidations should be granted to everybody, just just the neurodiverse employees.

In this document we cover adjusatments in the following AREAS;

- office environment

    How to survey an office for potential sensory issues, with recommended simple fixes and warnings of potential cost implications

- meetings

    A detailed instructions for how to schedule meetings sensibly and reasonably

- communications

    Communication issues are rarely the fault of a single individual, but the fault of every party involved in the conversation, we should not assign blame to any person when it fails, but collectively work harder to improve communication difficults and reach a middle ground.

- job interviews 

- ways of working

    Suggestions of accomidations and adjustments for the ND indivdual, that might go down like a tonne of bricks

Neurodiversity is an important emerging topic in the last few years, with developments made in ADHD and Autism diagnosises, frequency of diagnosis is increasing dramatically as more and more is understood about these conditions.

However a lot more educational work about correcting some of the misunderstandings of Autism/ADHD/ND needs to be done amongst the general populus, stereotypically representations of autistic indivduals within the media world has been damaging, such as rain man, and sheldon cooper in the big bang theory; of a incredibly smart but unempathic and emotionally numb male persona that likes trains.

/* top wank here needs rewriting to be less sloppy */

Autism expands beyond these stereotypes and has been damaging to those outside of them, such females and members of the BAME community, often being missed by formally diagnositic processes because they don't adhere to this commonly advertised trope.

Autism in many different countries aroudn the world is considered a disability, in  this context it can be viewed as a disablity by environmental circumstances, autisim is a difference in the way a person think and how their brain is wired, this causes conflict and distress when navigating a world built for a neurotypical mindset.

In a world which struggles to acknowledge and accomodate such differences, a person can suffer burnout and meltdowns due to several different factors that they may or may not be personal aware of just by performing their daily routine, they may struggle with noisy environments, or bright lights, unwanted smells, disruptions to routine and lack of structure.

There is also a substantial toll imposed upon an autistic indivdual who is unable to behave and act like a neurotpyical indivdual, causing them to mask and act like every other person just to avoid deregation and bullying, or to avoid being persistently the blame for repeated poor communications issues.

The world in it's current form is not a very inclusion place and this needs to change, with enough individual voices shouting in unison the world can begin to slowly change foer the better, with understanding and inclusion playing a key role.

Making the world a more neurodiverse inclusive place makes it a world better for everybody.

There is a low number (30% or lower) of Autistic people in employment when there needn't be, struggling to successfully pass through a typical interview process, and survive, with adjustments and awareness to the ismple changes a work environment can make, we make the world more inclusion for the autistic community.

The aim is not to give the average autistic person an advantage over everybody else, but to level the playing field so that they are on equal footing and given the chance to succeed.

We must all help to build a world that identifies everybodies unqiue strengths and appeals to them, and not build a world that focusses on individuals weaknesses and views them through a magnifying glass.

Creating a "test-your-metal" world and mentality where everbody is pushed & stressed to their limits to demonstrate that they're capable of fitting in the world is something we need to discourge.

Somebodies value should be be judged by how well they can deal with being pushed to their limits and our acceptences of another persons should not be limited to how useful we think they are to society and ourselves.

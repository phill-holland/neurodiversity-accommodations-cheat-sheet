# How To Communication Effectively

- [ ] Avoid ambigious language

        *** provide an example of common poor language here ****

- [ ] Be happy to provide clarification when asked

        Do not be offended if somebody asks several times for clarification on the same points, do not assume with communication difficulties that it's entirely the other persons fault for not understanding, communication difficulties is the responsibility of both participants in the conversation

- [ ] Ask about communication preferences

        Not all comunication is verbal, provide alternative options, such as text only chat, email, voice only calls

- [ ] Keep focussed on a single topic during a conversation

        Context switching is difficult, not keeping focus during a meeting increases cognative load on the participants, be strict and maintain focus unless the topic for discussion has reached an end both parties mutually agree on.

        A person with ADHD may flip between several subjects at once and potentially derail the conversation, but time and consideration still still be given to gauge if these tangent points are truely irrelevent to the conversation or building an argument to demonstrate and strengthen a point.

-[ ] Do not insist people give you the answers to questions asked during a meeting

        Even if urgent, try to resist the urge to pressure for an answer to an issue immediately.

        A person may need time to process everything that has happened during a conversation, sometimes if an important decision needs to be made and they are rushed into a decision they can often make the incorrect decision, or agree to something that is not within their best interests.

        An ND person can often be a people pleaser, efforts must be made to avoid pushing into saying "yes" to another task to complete, when in reality if they had time to think about it and reflect upon something, to realise saying "no" was a better choice for everybody to manage mutual responsibility.

- [ ] Do not use accusatory language when a misunderstanding occurs

        Assigning blame to another for poor communication immediately creates a defensive position, esculating a discussion into an argument quickly, language such as "you misunderstood" or resorting to defensive mode when somebody doesn't understand your point will generate a poor reaction.
        
        Even when you believe you are explaining something simple, you may still not be doing a good job of communicating, resisting the urge to get frustrated and instead try to find alternative ways to get the point across.

        "maybe I didn't quite explain that correctly" is a better phrase when confusion ensues, and then attempting to explain things in a different way (avoiding repeating again exactly what you said previous, just in a different tone) or find different ways of communicating other than verbal, for instance drawing a diagram.

- [ ] Do not interrupted people mid-sentence

        Just don't.  It will be very upsetting to the ND mind, and won't be able to focus on anything else until they finish their sentence.

- [ ] Give time for difference speech cadences

        People can speak slower, or need extra time to formulate a sentence, exercise patiences and try not to overload the other person with a swamp of words to fill in silences, silences are ok.

        Do not assume a person with a slow speech pattern is less intelligent than yourself.

        In the context of a meeting & as a host, you should be responsible for controlling those who are quicker to answer questions, often immediately responses aren't the best considered options for selection;  however the responsibility for this lays with all meeting attendees.

        Do not assume a person has finished talking if they have slightly longer delays between words than normal, avoid interrupting or ending their sentences with information they were about to divulge in due time.

- [ ] Do not ask a question to a person than list optional answers

        If you're asking a question, you don't know the answer, give them space to think about hte question and provide an answer, it is not good practise to list a set of answers to your own question, literal thinkers will believe these are the only options, and none of them may be a correct answer.

- [ ] Be concise

        Try to avoid sentences that don't communicate any detail, or avoid cliche sayings that have hidden meaning. (should probably explain this)

# Video Calls

- [ ] Reassure people and make them feel comfortable about turning off camera

        a camera on encourages a person to engage in masking activities, such as eye contact, or resisting the urge to stim in a stressful situtation, such as rocking backwards and forwards or pacing the room.

        Do not assume a person with their camera is absent from the meeting or not listening, exercise trust and reassurance.

- [ ] Enable text chat

- [ ] Enable transcriptions

# Text Communication

- [ ] Bullet Points

        Consider reformatting all communicate into a bullet pointed list of items.

- [ ] Bold Important Text

        So a person can quickly scan a text block for just the important things they need to know.

        usually in a work context, two things are the most important, "what do you need" and "when".

- [ ] Avoid Walls Of Text

        Break up sentences with extra spacing, logically organised into paragraphs communicating a single idea/point per paragraph.

        Remove excessive words, strongly edit your text.

- [ ] Dylexsic safe font

        Comic Sans (for all the hate it gets) is a good font that is easier to read!  Also that other one, which bolds beginning and end characters.

        Not just for dyslexics, this benefits everybody!

        (suggest more fonts here)

- [ ] Avoid unnessercary small talk

        It's ok to not start a message with "hello, how are you?" - if you're not wanting a detailed answer to this question, do not ask the question.  Is it ok to send a message and jump right into want you need to ask.

Often during communication there is a lot of implied context, sub-text and references that are left unspoken between participants with an assumption that both sides understand that implied meaning - but this isn't always the case, even between neurotypicals as well as the neurodivergent.

A person may be confident that are an effective communicator, perhaps because they are warm and friendly and talkative but under scrunity they may actually exchange very little useful information.  

Just because the two parties in a conversation made each other feel good does not mean they have effectively communicated what they needed to say.  Just because the outcome of a conversation was positive too, when perhaps one person asks another person to do a task and they complete it successfully, still does not validate the effectiveness of the communication.

Context and meaning isn't always communicated during a single conversation, but often references many other previous conversations, often people develop their own ways of using the English language, referencing past shared events with single words and sound that mean very little to the casual external observer.   

These references and context don't just occur between two people in isloation, but can happen on a larger scale within society as a whole, and those references may never be spoken or shared amongst people formally, society has an abundance of unspoken rules that neurotypicallys follow naturally.

In generalised society hidden meaning and context can be easier for a neurotypical person to pick up on, context can be gauged subconciously from other social cues that the neurodivergent person may not be able to read, this may include body language and facial expressions and reading how other people are reacting to the words being spoken.


Communication differences and misunderstandings are usually placed at the fault of the neurodivergent person in the conversation when something is miscommunicated, but often the fault is rarely ever due to a single person, often the average person communicates intent and meaning and needs in a un-concise and indirect way.

Take this example;

```
"What do you think of my new dress?"
```

This is a loaded question, it is a trap, the person asking the question is most likely not seeking an honest answer, they are fishing for a compliment, even if it's the most ugly dress in the world you lose the game if you say this out loud.  The literal meaning of the words spoken do not communicate this need for positive validation.  It is also an open ended question, lacking specifics, what specifically are you asking about the dress, do I like the colour and pattern?, the choice of fabric?, the way it is cut? 

The person asking the question has communicated badly about what they actually need from the other person.

Take this example, where a manager is talking to a member of their team;

```
"Can you finished that off by tomorrow afternoon?"
```





"the bark is worse than their bite"







More frequently too, people may use 


neurotypically minds tend to pick up on those hidden meanings without having to be told directly, it comes naturally whilst the neurodivegent mind struggles because t

establishing preferences and respecting them

Tasks need to be communicated concisely
●Communication preferences may not be verbal - ESTABLISH COMMS PREFERENCES, WRITTEN/VERBAL - other?? interpretive dance?
●Extra time may be needed to process information
●Having the camera on and making eye contact may be uncomfortable
●Try to avoid interruption people in mid-sentence


Be patient, some people take longer to form sentences than others



●Specify deadline dates directly
●What you need and when
●Bullet pointed list
●Be literal, don’t imply
●Try to avoid micromanaging
●Be open to criticism that you may have communicated poorly
●Avoid walls of text
●Avoid meaningless small talk when it’s obvious you want something
●Be open to different modes of preferred communications

"This needs to be ready by tomorrow afternoon"

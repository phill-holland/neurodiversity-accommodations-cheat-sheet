- Autism <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/what-is-autism">(more information)</a>

        Autism is defined in it's simplest form as;

        "A neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave"
        
        It is a lifelong condition that affects adults as well as children, it is traditional largely a misunderstood condition amongst the general population with many poor stereotypes being perpetuated.

        Autism is a hidden condition, there may be no visible signs presented external.

 - Neurodiverse

        A term used to describe a person who does not have a mindset that would be described as typical and normal compared to the larger population.  This term can cover those with Autism and ADHD.

-  Neurotypical

        A person who may be typically describe as having a "normal" or typical mindset and thought pattern.

- ASD

        Autism Spectrum Disorder, typically it is frowned upon to refer to Autism as a disorder, general speaking a person with autism is disabled by environment, in the same way a person in a wheelchair is disabled only when there are stairs everywhere, rather than ramps. 

        Autism is a condition rather than a disorder.

- ASC

        Autism Spectrum Condition (see above)

- ADHD

        Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

        Again, it can be argued ADHD is a condition, rather than a disorder.

- Asperger's <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/what-is-autism/the-history-of-autism/asperger-syndrome">(further information)</a>

        Previous diagnosis of autism was labelled as Asperger's, but in recent years people tend to avoid using this term due to negative associations with the doctor Hans Asperger's and his work relating to the Nazis.

- Masking <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/behaviour/masking">(further information)</a>

        A nuerodivergent person may develop a mask, this has the function of blending in to look more "normal", to avoid subjugation, exclusion and bullying.

        An autistic person, where natural facial expressions have to be actively thought about (such as smiling), may typically they may spend a large portion of time studying other people and scripting responsible to different social situations, such as learning to smile or pull a frown at the appropriate moment depending on positive or negative news.

- People Pleasing

        Often due to masking, autistic people adopt a people pleasing approach and put themselves to the said, to avoid conflict it's often easy to agree to everything a person wants of you, regardless of the personal harm & damage it may do.

        An autistic person can general be exploited easier because of this, and more prone to attracting abusers.

- Burnouts <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/autistic-burnout">(further information)</a>

        Masking all day is incredibly exhausting, this results in burnout; typically this may mean a person goes completely quiet and/or needs to recharge by cutting out all social activities and sitting in a quiet dark room.

        A burnout is a serious consequence, they can last for hours, but sometimes days months or even years, taking a long time to recover from.

- Meltdowns <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/behaviour/meltdowns/all-audiences">(further Information)</a>

        A reaction to overstimulation within an environment;  if a person is sensitive to noise, smells touch or something else and it's for example, been building up over the course of a few hours or days, usually unknowingly to the person, a meltdown can occur, which can be mis-interpreted as a "tantrum", shouting and screaming.

        It's important during a meltdown not to interrupt the process or become pushy, the person should be left alone, and gently encouraged to move to a quiet/sensory room to recover.  A person should not be confronted on restrained during this process.

- Stimming <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/behaviour/stimming">(further information)</a>

        "Self stimulating" or self soothing related activities to help with controlling anxiety.  This may include rocking backwards and forwards, flicking fingers of front of their eyes, pacing, playing with random object (elastic bands, repeatedly clicking pens) or specific stim-toys.

        Stimming can be an important aspect of an autistic persons day and can be a useful tool for inhibiting stress.

- ABA <a href="https://childmind.org/article/controversy-around-applied-behavior-analysis/">(further information)</a>

        Applied Behaviour Analysis Therapy.  A damaging therapy applied to "treat" autistic people by negatively reenforced externally visible autistic behaviours, such as stimming activities.

        This therapy treats autism from the external viewpoint of another person, identifying these behaviours as negative and damaging because they are viewed as irritating and undesirable by the therapist.

        ABA teaches an autistic person to develop a mask, rather than to cure autism (a cure for autism does not exist) - a mask can be highly damaging and exhausting to the autistic person, with severe mental health costs associated with it, resulting in burnout and other consequences, such as suicide.

- Autism Speaks

        An organisation typically frowned upon that claims to assist autistic people, but supports the use of ABA therapy.  It's board members is made up of a majority of mostly non-autistic people, with questionable representation of the autistic community.

- Gaslighting <a href="https://www.newportinstitute.com/resources/mental-health/what_is_gaslighting_abuse/">(source)</a>

        "Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse or manipulation in which the abuser attempts to sow self-doubt and confusion in their victim's mind. Typically, gaslighters are seeking to gain power and control over the other person, by distorting reality and forcing them to question their own judgment and intuition."


- PDA  <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/behaviour/demand-avoidance">(source)</a>

        Pathological Demand Avoidance

        "A persistent and marked resistance to demands is a characteristic experienced by and observed in some autistic people. It can impact essential needs like eating and sleeping, and expectations such as going to school or work, and has implications for diagnosis and support. People with lived experience have suggested strategies for self-management and support."

culture in office

meetings have to have a point?

communicated successful the agenda?

- purpose of meeting

- outcome of meeting

This gives people time to prepare, and also provides enough detail forf them to decide if theyh should attend or not



enabling freedom not to attend if they feel they will not contribute anything useless, or learn anything useful

record meetings for later

meetings should have options to be attended remotely, and not mandatory in-person


remote attendees should have the option to have the camera off (it doesn't mean they're not listening or paying attention)

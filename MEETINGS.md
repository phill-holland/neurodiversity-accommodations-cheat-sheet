# How to Schedule & host a Meeting

Have I...?

- [ ] Written a concise bullet pointed meeting description, describing the purpose of the meeting, the aims of the meetings and expected outcomes

        This enables the attendees the choice of whether to attend or not, and also gives them details of how prepared they need to be, it's important to also describe the priority of the meeting and how important it is to attend.

        A detailed oriented approach to meetings help reduce meetings for the sake-of-meetings.

        A poorly described meeting can also be the source of anxiety, a neurodiverse brain tends to think of the worse case scenerio, such as, is this the meeting I get fired in? Am I in trouble? Even the best performing employees may think this way.

        Ensure at the beginning of the meeting that the schedule is shared on-screen and briefly summeraised with all attendees before continuing the meeting.

- [ ] Thought about keeping the attendee list as small as possible

        Is the list of invited attendees small and concise?  Do all of those people really need to be there?  Will they contribute in any meaningful way to the outcome of the meeting?  Do they need to be aware of any decisions and outcomes of the meeting?  Can those outcomes be communicated in a different way?  Does a person need to be in attendence for the whole of the meeting?
                 
- [ ] Scheduled the meeting with enough notice > 2 days

        Last minute meetings generate anxiety and causes people to have to change their routine without much notice generating stress, putting meeting invites for the following morning in the late afternoon or evening removes people's ability to plan their own work day without interruption.
    

- [ ] Thought about the length of the meeting

        Calendar systems often default meetings be scheduled in hourly blocks, however if you work in a meeting heavy environment with back-to-back meetings you may want to consider reducing the meeting length to 45 minutes.  Shorter meetings help keep people focused during the meeting and stick to the proposed agenda.

        Having breaks in-between meetings helps people unwind and prepare for the next meeting, communication with a neurodiverse brain can be incredibly energy intensive and it's important to engineer breaks in-between meetings to allow for processing and rest time. 

- [ ] Considered the time of your meeting

        Try to avoid scheduling a meeting during lunch hours (12-2pm), or over common daily events at your company.  Many neurodivegent brains need to adhere to a routine to help maintain and manage anxiety, and regular routines and eating at a fixed time helps with this.

        Often a neurodivergent brain will forget to eat if their schedule is altered, and become even more anxious than usual, a break in routine can be the source of lots of stress.

        Break times such as lunch should also be respected, rest time is equally as important as work time, it should not be encouraging people to work through their break periods.

- [ ] Always allowed for the option to attend remotely

        Even if in-person attendee has been specified as mandatory, remote options should still be given for any exceptions that are more than likely the occur.  

        Ideally no in-person mandatory meeting should be schedule unless there's a clear benefit that can be communicated to everybody to it's importance.  In-person meetings should be frequently challenged as to there reasoning.


- [ ] Given the option to allow attendees to turn off their cameras

        Neurodivegent brains find it incredibly unconfortable to appear in front of a camera, often focussing on themselves and any imperfection and details within their own face, they may also feel the need to "act" and keep up their mask, and avoid calming activities whilst on a call, which may be stressful to them, including needing to rock backwards and forwards, or pace to calm the anxiety and help them focus. 

        Eye contact can also be an issue for the neurodivegent brain, most of the time they'll be thinking so much on how to mask successfully rather than on the content on the meeting and contributing a higher quaility of work.

        A turned off camera and muted mic doesn't mean that person is not paying attention.


- [ ] Remembered to record the meeting and make publicly available on work slack channels

        To support the freedom of people choicing which meetings to attend, ideally a meeting should be recorded and then shared with the appropriate people.

        Some people may also be on holiday or sick and need to catch-up when they return.

        Do not wait for people to ask you for a copy of the recording, ensuring it has been published visibly to the appropriate people.

- [ ] Enabled text chat options

        Consider alternative ways a person can contribute to a meeting beyond having to be vocal, consider alternative communication methods that a person may be more confortable with, such as text chat in the side bar.

        Some people may feel it is difficult to "jump in" an active conversation even when they've been encourage to do so, a neurodiverse brain may find it difficult to identify nature pauses in conversations in which to conbtribute.

        Encourage all forms of communication as much as possible. 

        The host of the meeting should be frequently checking the text messages and reading them out at an appropriate time to the rest of the attendees.

- [ ] Give time for everybody to speak in turn, be patient

        Ensure there is a mechnaism for people who find it difficult to jump into an ongoing conversation to have them interrupt and contribute and join in, such as a virtual "hand up" button.

        When somebody does speak, or if somebody is asked a question, give them time to formulate an answer, some people may be slower at creating sentences than others and then vocalising them.

        Try not to interupt mid-sentence, and try not to jump in with a reply unless you are sure they have finished what they were saying.

        Neurodiverse mindsets put a lot of energy into speaking, they wobn't always be the ones to speak first and will likely be considered in their answers to questions, it's important to be patient and understanding with this, you may miss a valuable contribution if you do not control the more "vocally quick" members of the meeting.

- [ ] Written up notes and summaries at the end of the meeting and shared publicly on work slack channels

        Automated annotation and transcrtiption software are now available to do this for you.  If you do not have access to this software it's still important to write-up each meeting with a set of bullet points and decisions made and then communicated to all relevent people, such as on a teams or slack chat channel.

- [ ] Consider ending the meeting early

        If it's clear the direction has been lost in a meeting, or goes off on a tangent, or reaches a summary quickly, end the meeting early, allow everybody to return to their jobs.  Do not allow the meeting to go on for longer than is required.

        Some people like to use this time for social chit-chat, but the host should give people the freedom to leave or engage in this if they wish, people sohuld not be frowned upon for wanting to leave early.
